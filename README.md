# cakephp-rootui
Root UI theme for CakePHP applications

Root UI is a minimalist responsive theme, more info here: https://themeforest.net/item/rootui-react-admin-dashboard/24852340

This plugin will allow you to use that theme with your CakePHP application. Although I first have to figure out how to make this work knowing that you would have to buy the theme first! So I cannot upload the theme files yet, which are needed in this plugin.

Also, need to refactor because it contains a Helper and a Cell that should not be part of the theme. To be split off into separate plugin.

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

```
composer require C8Robin/cakephp-rootui
```
