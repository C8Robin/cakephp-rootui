# cakephp-rootui
Root UI theme for CakePHP applications

Root UI is a minimalist responsive theme, more info here: https://themeforest.net/item/rootui-react-admin-dashboard/24852340

This plugin will allow you to use that theme with your CakePHP application.

NOTE: this plugin does *NOT* contain the required Root UI files!

Need to refactor because it contains a Helper and a Cell that should not be part of the theme. To be split off into separate plugin.

## Requirements
* CakePHP
* RootUI theme: the theme will provide the necessary css, js, img and font files that this plugin relies on

## Installation

You can install this plugin into your CakePHP application using [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

The recommended way to install composer packages is:

```
composer require C8Robin/cakephp-rootui
```
